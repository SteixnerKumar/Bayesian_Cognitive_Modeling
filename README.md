# General idea
This is an experimental setup of the 'tiger task'.

The game is played always by a dyad (two participants) either independent of each other (TT) or with each other (ITT).
The experiment runs on a single computer ideally connected to two screens. These screens are partly covered so that the individual participants visually only access their part of the task.
